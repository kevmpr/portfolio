            🎓 I'm currently in the second year, second semester of an Advanced
            Technical Degree in Software Development, a rigorous programme
            focused on real-world application of programming, systems analysis,
            and cloud-based solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            ✒️ With 14 out of 23 subjects already completed, I've built a strong
            foundation in computer science fundamentals, object-oriented
            programming, databases, and agile methodologies. My academic journey
            blends technical depth with practical skills, preparing me to face
            challenges with both precision and adaptability.
          </p>

          <p>
            📚 Right now, I'm focused on subjects that reflect where the industry
            is heading:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>• Web Systems Development - Back End</li>
            <li>• Web Systems Development - Front End</li>
            <li>• Software Engineering</li>
            <li>• Development and Implementation of CloudSystems</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            💼 This curriculum aligns perfectly with my hands-on experience in
            full-stack development and cloud engineering. It allows me to
            continuously connect what I learn in the classroom with what I build
            in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            🎯 I see education not as a checkbox, but as an active tool to level up
            my thinking, refine my technical skills, and deepen the impact I can
            have as a developer.

            📊 I'm currently enrolled in a 4-month intensive training programme
            focused on cloud technologies, data, and low-code development, with
            a strong emphasis on Microsoft Azure.
          </p>

          <p>
            🧰 This hands-on experience is helping me build solid foundations in
            cloud infrastructure and scalable architectures. I'm preparing for
            the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) certification, with AZ-104 (Azure
            Administrator) as my next milestone to deepen my skills in cloud
            management.
          </p>

          <p>
            🧠 More than just theory, this programme is sharpening my ability to
            think strategically, solve real-world problems, and contribute
            effectively in team-driven environments—paving the way for my future
            in cloud engineering.
